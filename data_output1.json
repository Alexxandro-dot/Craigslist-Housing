The filter is a PiperCross high flow Foam cone filter housed in a carbon fiber composite enclosed canister that connects directly to the an coke intake pickup at the front of the vehicle with an application specific inlet scoop. Everything is connected via high quality silicone couplers. The system creates a true ram air effect, and will only see airflow from outside the vehicle with absolutely no hot air from within the engine that could reduce power. We have dyno tested this kit, and have seen gains as high as 10 peak wheel horsepower improvement over the stock airbox and filter on Stage 2 tuned vehicles. Whilst Power gains may vary depending on your modifications and level of tune, this kit will offer a significant improvement over the original air box*\n\n*Please note some models have a noise resonator connected to the air intake pipe that will have to be disconnected and left unused when installing the Forge Motorsport induction kit. This will however not detract from the performance of the induction kit.\n\n*Please note - the Pipercross filter is excluded from the Forge lifetime warranty*"

I bought it new from Creaform in November of 2014. It is a fantastic tool that isn't getting used enough. There are no defects, scratches, dents, or any blemishes. Anything you see that may look questionable is likely just dust or fingerprints. It comes with several hundred targets for better acquisition on larger common surface area scans. A cool feature of the scanner is it will rely on the geometry of the object to reposition itself if you stop scanning for a coffee break. You can pick up the scanner and start scanning anywhere near the areas you already scanned, and the scanner will continue scanning based on the geometry of the part you already scanned. It comes with one licence of VXelements. Solidworks Premium also has a preinstalled addon called ScanTo3D that will run this scanner without the need to buy additional software or use the VXelements. This has the same specifications as the Go!SCAN 50 except this one does not have the ability to scan the color of the object."
